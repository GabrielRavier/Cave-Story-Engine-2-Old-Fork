This is a static build of FreeType 2.9.1, built with MSVC2003.

Despite the lack of a compatible .sln file, it can be built by running
'make setup visualc' and then 'make' in the root of the Freetype source
directory while in a Visual Studio 2003 Command Prompt, using a MinGW
Make utility (e.g. C:/msys64/mingw32/bin/make.exe).
