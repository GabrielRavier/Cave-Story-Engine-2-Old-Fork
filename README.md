# Cave Story Engine 2 (Enhanced)

Cave Story Engine 2 is a decompilation of Cave Story, ported from DirectX to SDL2.

This branch adds several enhancements including:
* PNG support
* Full alpha blending support
* Fixed text blending, utilising the aforementioned alpha support
* Externalised resource files
* [Booster's Lab](https://github.com/taedixon/boosters-lab) support
* 60FPS
* Widescreen
* Vastly-improved fullscreen
* Removal of the feature that locks sprites to a 320x240 grid when drawn (can easily be [reenabled](src/Draw.cpp#L540) for stylistic purposes)

## Dependencies

* SDL2
* FreeType
* pkg-config

## Building

The main way to build the project is 'the Linux way':

Just run 'make' in the base directory, preferably with some of the following settings:

* RELEASE=1 to compile a release build (optimised, stripped, etc.)
* STATIC=1 to produce a statically-linked executable (good for Windows builds, so you don't need to bundle DLL files)
* JAPANESE=1 to enable the Japanese-language build (instead of the unofficial Aeon Genesis English translation)
* FIX_BUGS=1 to fix certain bugs (see [src/Bug Fixes.txt](src/Bug%20Fixes.txt))
* WINDOWS=1 to enable Windows-only features like a unique file/taskbar icon, and system font loading (needed for the font setting in Config.dat to do anything)
* RASPBERRY_PI=1 to enable tweaks to improve performance on Raspberry Pis
* NONPORTABLE=1 to enable bits of code that aren't portable, but are what the original game used

Project files for Visual Studio 2003 are also available, in the 'msvc/msvc2003' directory (VS2003 was what Pixel used to compile the original EXE).

## Running

Because of the modifications made in this branch, a custom data folder is needed. These can be found in the 'res' folder: [one for Japanese builds](res/dataJp), [and one for English](res/dataEn).

## Licensing

Being a decompilation, the majority of the code in this project belongs to Daisuke "Pixel" Amaya - not us. We've yet to agree on a license for our own code.
